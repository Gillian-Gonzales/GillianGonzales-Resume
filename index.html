        <p class="lead mb-4">Hello! I am currently a 19 year old student from Los Angeles, California currently attending the University of California, Riverside, as a second year psychology major. Attending Eagle Rock Jr./Sr. High SchoolI was heavily involved with extracurricular activities such as the athletic program, KeyClub, and WISH, supporting the development of my solid time management, social, and commitment skills. I have gained the ability to interact well with others to complete problem solving tasks and am always open to constructive criticism. Amidst the global pandemic and therefore remote learning, I have been adapting to the use of technology as my means of both education and communication with professors and fellow students as I have made the decision to remain home. While I am a full time student, I also have experience being an essential worker; I am currently employed at Target where I participate as both a cashier and barista. Besides work and school, I enjoy spending the rest of my time bullet journaling or creating art as I use both as an expressive outlet to cope with stress; I have adapted to and maintained the habit of bullet journaling for about a years, utilizing it almost everyday to situate how I plan out my weeks in advance and organize whatever tasks that need to be completed. On the other hand, while I have broadened my methods of art from ink and paper to yarn and cloth, both remain to be therapeutic ways of destressing. To balance the seemingly constant heavy workload on my plate, I consistently emphasize the importance of mental health and self care. As mentioned, I partake in activities during my freetime that allow me to destress; however, before current events, specifically the pandemic, I relied heavily on physical activity and wellness as healthy coping mechanisms. My first year of college had consisted of a weekly workout routine that not only helped me maintain my physique, but it had also encouraged me to have a more productive day as I enjoyed going to the gym early in the morning. With this routine, I was able to provide myself with inner motivation and sense of control, which overall contributed to my developing independence. In addition to the benefits of consistently working out I had gained a year ago, getting my first real job in July has solidified the significance of a strong work ethic to adequately manage my previously stated priorities. Engaging in various opportunities as a working student as helped me familiarize myself with situations that require efficient communication skills, problem solving under pressure, and proactivity. The commitments I’ve chosen to make since highschool throughout college continue improve my preparedness for adulthood. Because of this, I now understand the importance of physical activity (or rather productive methods of destressing), time management, and routine in relationship to the quality of work I produce academically and in my physical work environment. While there’s always room for improvement, I can confidently prioritize and manage my time/tasks in an organized and beneficial manner.<br><br>
